# Welcome to Sphere2Pano

This tool converts the live feed of a camera from a spherical image to a panorama.

## Aim the camera
Once your camera is plugged in, [open the live feed](live.html) and aim the camera at mirrored-sphere. Try to make the sphere as big as possible, like in the image below.

Once calibaration is complete, [you can access the stream](stream.html).
